# Summarization-NLP
We have used a pre-trained language model (PLM) to train a system that produces a laymanâ€™s summary given a research publication from the biomedical domain.

## This repository contains:
-**flant5-finetune.py** - Training code to finetune a FLAN-T5 model
-**flant5-inference.py** - A code used to do inference with the model
-**run_model.sh** - Entry point for model training and inference.
-**writeup.txt** - A text file listing your approach, results and settings of experiments 
-**plos.txt and elife.txt** - Outputs generated on the test data.
-**link.txt** - A link to the Google Drive folder containing the trained model 
-**screenshot.jpg** -  a screenshot of our submission to CodaBench
-**prediction_result.zip.** - predicted results on the test data that is submitted to CodaBench
